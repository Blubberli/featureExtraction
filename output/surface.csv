cag71xz	I believe he spends too much time playing battlefield 3, the current game that plays for about 1-3 hours a day. Although he gets As in his classes and has a good social life, as well as the fact he is physically healthy, I believe that he spends too much time looking at that bright, flashing screen (although he does not *appear* hyperactive) to have a good developing brain. I think that he can definitely handle the game's gruesome parts, though it has an M rating, and I am not concerned about that. His argument is that he gets his schoolwork done and is healthy and happy, but I believe that he is not truly happy because he spends too much time playing these games.	So whats you're argument that he's spending too much time playing it?

I'm certain a percentage of date rapes are for the sex. But rape via strangers or acquaintances/borderline-strangers is almost always about the power dynamic. I can go look for interviews from rapists and the victims about this, if you're interested.

This is why actors get paid a lot. They generate tons of money from movies and shows. The more money your industry generates, the more money you make. 	I like this answer.

Please understand that I am being distinct between government employees (bureaucrats/the military) and individuals receiving welfare, as the former actually provide a service.

Common sense is a rhetorical device referring to ingrained social mores, like stereotypes. Additionally, relying on common sense allows bias to go completely unchecked.

ck4dwad	That's one consideration, but I wasn't aware of wide-spread abusive relationships in the gay community. I didn't hear many arguments about brainwashing and abandoning children in the gay marriage debate. There are a lot of behaviors which are not considered normal and do not have a documented link to abuse, like furries. Similarly, if we normalized sex with children I don't think that would decrease the amount of abuse. The normalness of behavior is one of many factors and is not outcome-determinative. Even if you still think that plural marriage should be constitutionally protected, do you now acknowledge that there are legitimate arguments on the other side?	"Goodness, yes, of course there are ""legitimate"" arguments on both sides. There are legitimate arguments for and against marriage equality. There are legitimate arguments against marriage itself. It depends on how low you set the bar for legitimate. I'm not aware of any specific abuses in early 20th century gay culture either. I'm saying that pushing a group underground leaves that group ripe to abuse and be abused. Partners today are already slow to report abuse, I'd wager it'd be slower if the victim also faced arrest. (when you bring the child sex argument into the equation, please remember that the same types of arguments were used by awful bigots against same-gender marriage. You should be mindful to tread lightly.) Furries can take off their ourfits. It's really hard to hide your husband (gay or straight), or your husbands (gay or straight, plural). If we normalize plural relationships we can help victims. If normalized I'd wager they'd have similar rates of abuse to other households."	0.9690222556651344	0.8194483718728035	0.9283832117695864	0.7536839766284379	0.8112781244591328	neutral	0.0173330549150705	expert	0.2580186724662781	0.1437133103609085	69.60630502445534	11.334637616718542	4.6531791907514455	1.4624277456647399	0.6763005780346821	0.20398009950248755	0.12935323383084577
caujut4	"First off, definitions. By price discrimination, I am referring to the practice of offering discounts or different prices to select groups. For example: a student discount on software or a bus ride, reduced prices for seniors at a movie theatre, ladies night drink prices at a bar, ""children-eat-free-tuesdays"", etc. Now, I understand the rationale behind this type of business model. By segmenting the market based on disposable income, it is possible to increase profits. There may even be other benefits (i.e. giving women an incentive to attend your bar or club could increase overall sales). However, I feel that it should be the right of any customer, regardless of market demographic, to be able to demand the lowest price. Anything else is unfair and wrong. CMV!"	The thing is different people are willing to spend different amounts on the same service/good. The amount of price people are willing to pay forms a bell curve. Once you set a price you are serving all people on one side of the line and are totally denying service to everyone on the other side of the line. The people who are paying are happy since they are paying a price they are comfortable with or even cheaper. Those people who are unwilling to pay your cost and are not served at all and are unhappy. Price discrimination allows you to address the needs of those people. You offer them a slightly inconvenient coupon that is only good on Wednesday and now the price is lowered for them so that they are willing to pay. They're happy, everyone paying the normal price is happy, and you're happy. It's win/win/win. If you disallow price discrimination you would never serve the needs of these people. If you lowered the price for everyone then you end up losing money from all those people who are perfectly happy with the normal price.	0.8866828800015338	0.8527924884900404	0.5995651746192718	0.2167415674429225	0.7642045065086203	neutral	3.317152732051909e-05	expert	0.1932328641414642	0.1804014593362808	82.96604967197752	10.353514526710404	4.304123711340206	1.2525773195876289	0.4742268041237113	0.13333333333333333	0.0761904761904762
calmzrr	It seems to me that as more and more smartphones are released, along with them come a new slew of apps and social networking tools. Examples of this would be BBM's among blackberries, or apps like Tinder that are available only on the iOS. With every new app or phone feature, a community is created by its users, and this community is undoubtedly stronger the larger that it is. In the case of Tinder, for example, the app is worthless if its user base is small, but can be a pivotal networking tool if widespread. So it's obvious to me that even if a company like Nokia implements some brand new networking tool or app that's better than any other of its kind, if it's not available and used by a large user group, it's just not worth it. Essentially, I think it's always the most socially beneficial to own the most popular product, and this can even be applied to other products, not just phones. I know there must be an alternative to this thinking, but I can't wrap my head around it. Change my view?	&>>I believe that the phone that is most beneficial to own is the one that most other people own. CMV This seems like an obvious statement.

However this is hardly the greatest reason that iphones or other popular phones are popular: I would think that it is because of their pleasant operating system and visually appealing exterior. 	0.9462651872218008	0.579380164285695	0.58212143525442	0.4248308683213957	0.7642045065086203	positive	3.418655978748575e-05	expert	0.080629214644432	0.4795256555080414	67.63960573476704	12.82437275985663	4.754838709677419	1.4387096774193548	0.6129032258064516	0.22033898305084745	0.12994350282485875
cp0tsgv	Your example with Parks and Recreations isn't the best one, because the episode mocked feminist organizations just as much. Now, I agree there's a tendency of the more outspoken feminists on the internet to ignore or even dismiss men-related issues, but I think a movement like feminism geared toward men would never work because the idea behind feminism is fighting opression. Men deal with a lot of crap, but how much of it comes from being considered a lesser type of human? Feminism in its best form is about getting women at the same level as men, men's rights in its best form is about making men's lives better. I'm all for both ideas, but when people start comparing the situations I have a hard time taking them seriously.	Parks and Rec mocked one feminist organization; it completely disregarded all of men's issues. &>>Men deal with a lot of crap, but how much of it comes from being considered a lesser type of human?

These are things like disallowing denial of coverage for people with preexisting conditions, insuring the poor and unhealthy through exchanges, etc. I am of the belief that insurance companies will actually thrive under the new law.

"While the ACA is written in the way you describe (Obama specifically met with the leadership of many insurance companies in order to ensure they would be on board), it nevertheless poses an existential risk for insurance companies. Right now, our health care system is a kludge of insurance-based, government-provided, and self-pay. The ACA increasingly penalizes the self-pay category, which in the short run drives them towards the insurance-based category. However, there is a strong possibility that eliminating the self-pay category will eliminate many of the remaining market incentives in the system, resulting an increased drive towards single-payer health care. Simultaneously, the government will be able to regulate health insurance plans more and more heavily - it currently imposes extra requirements on ""bare bones"" insurance and taxes ""Cadillac"" insurance - encouraging more and more uniformity until the companies' products look identical to government coverage. This also helps forge a potential path towards single-payer health care. This is how Obama sold the plan to progressives, certainly - and I don't think anyone knows how it will actually play out.

caxh01x	The stock market was invented as a way to find rapid investment for an expanding brick &amp;amp;amp; mortar company and to find people who could directly benefit off such an investment. This has evolved into an insanely large global enterprise that is completely unsustainable and filled with middle men who have no direct interest in the actual party and profit hugely while mostly bankrupting the investor and the companies themselves. The companies of tomorrow will directly reach out to the consumer and expand organically without finding the necessity to actually be responsible to a bunch of stock market rules or trends. I believe this change will also be a good thing. Change my view. 	IPOs are cash grabs. They are good for generating huge amounts of capital needed for investment from *people who can actually afford it*.

So unless kick starter develops a method to encourage serious investment on the scale of billions instead of, what was the largest one again? 10 million? Industry sneezes at ten million. Stocks are a guaranteed portion of that companies future profits in return for a sum of capital upfront used for investment. Kickstarter is a sum of capital up front for whatever the dev deems appropriate, an album, a game, etc. Stocks can be retraded for a loss or gain when the investor feels it is right. 	0.9462651872218008	0.7725068857142602	0.7139509316223277	0.5821214352544201	0.9910760598382222	neutral	3.199553975719027e-05	negative	0.2263645231723785	0.1783661395311355	63.55816707218169	12.512246553122466	4.7153284671532845	1.510948905109489	0.7299270072992701	0.24025974025974026	0.14285714285714285

Now, sex is complicated because one little mistake can have life-altering consequences, and yet I was under the assumption that OP was talking about instances of overreach, where a father's protective instincts could censor his daughter out of a healthy sex life.

This will be all over the body including back, neck, chest, face etc. There are too many tattoos showing off the violence they've done and the carnage they have caused or just showing what gang they are in. If this was to be removed then I believe it will reduce the crimes within prisons. I do not believe it would be invading their human rights so far that it would be considered unfair as they are only allowed basic human rights when sent to prison in the first place. Anything more is ignored. Prisoners would be checked upon entering prison and routine checks would be made for tattoos made within the prison walls monthly. Do you think I am right or wrong with a thought like this, if not, change my view. Regards Jack Edit: This would also include removal of symbols representing something offensive/boastful as well.

cdmum67	You know how many people it takes to make 20 ATMs? Or to maintain (yes, you mentioned that), refill and unload, upgrade, program, and clean 20 ATMs? You know how ATMs are made? They use factories, and somewhat specialized machinery to produce. People work at those machines, and maintain them, and clean them. People run the factories, and other people build and own them. (there's plenty of rabbit-hole left to go down if you don't get the idea yet...)	What happens when we fully automate factories, and lose those jobs to automation and technology? Not long ago, you might need 5 Linux sysadmins to manage 1000 servers. Now with tools like puppet or cfengine you need 2. The basic point is that technology and automation will remove available jobs, and they will not be replaced by other 'more skilled' jobs. We will get to a point where more than 50% of the population simply cannot be employed.	0.8866828800015338	0.3175206571427802	0.7548533836336261	0.7139509316223277	0.7642045065086203	neutral	3.3590258681215346e-05	GPT	0.4629164934158325	0.0254954751580953	74.071417721519	11.383291139240507	4.506329113924051	1.379746835443038	0.7848101265822784	0.16666666666666666	0.1111111111111111
cn1r9a8	I agree with your concern. Whether or not our workforce will have the skills for the jobs of tomorrow. Thats valid. But my point is also valid. For the 100 data entry jobs that no longer exist, there is not going to be 100 jobs in data storage/efficiency, high performance computing, etc. For the 100 jobs that were replaced, perhaps 50 new jobs emerged in these new fields. And my point is that as this trend continues, repeated hundreds of time over as technology and productivity and efficiency improve, you get more jobs replaced with less jobs that may or may not be more technical or different. Eventually, in 100% efficiency, all real work is automated.	I understand your concern that this trend eventually will lead to the concept of a job becoming obsolete. But I don't agree that we're losing jobs at even nearly that rate. Do you have any data to support that available jobs are disappearing at 50%? Considering there's only been a slight upward trend in unemployment in the US over the past 50 years, I really doubt this is the case. I also think you should consider that the creation of a new industry does not necessarily wipe out the old one. For example, cloud computing is a relatively new industry that's risen quickly in the past 5 years but it hasn't replaced the software industry. Instead, cloud computing delivers applications in a way that traditional software can't, but still serves the same purpose. This is what I'm talking about - needing intelligent, competent people moving in to fill those little crevices and create growing industries that provide jobs.	0.6591474818395388	0.482159360969681	0.5273179854716311	0.4248308683213957	0.5032583347756457	negative	3.3035335945896804e-05	negative	0.6045674681663513	0.0251171216368675	71.66483907185629	13.858982035928145	4.467065868263473	1.347305389221557	0.6826347305389222	0.2122905027932961	0.12849162011173185
ckogjl3	"I believe that if consoles seized to exist, PC gaming as we know it would fail. As we know, performance and graphical visuals are for more superior on PC than current-gen consoles but we never see an all round improvement on either consoles or PC until the next generation of consoles comes along. For example - PS2/Xbox era, PC games did look far better than their console counterpart, but the overall mass production of games during that generation didn't ""change"" until the next generation, and the same goes for PS3/360 vs Xbox One/PS4 generation. _____ "	"So? That doesn't show that PC needs consoles, just that PC games improve at generally the same rate - which, by the way, isn't even true. PC games have been at ""X-Box One/PS4 era"" graphics since the PS3/360 era. Have you seen Skyrim and Bioshock in 4K? You can't even do that on a PS4, and those are last generation games. Also, think back to the 90s. We had games in 1997 (Half-Life) that couldn't be ported to console until 2001 (PS2.) I think in many ways PC has been always one generation ahead.

ca6zyep	"Personally, I believe that people who identify as ""genderqueer"" or ""agender"" are taking the state of being, for example, a more feminine male and turning it into a much bigger deal than it need be. People exist as either male or female, and one can be a girly dude or a masculine girl, but it doesn't mean one is a totally different gender. As to ""genderfluid,"" everyone wakes up in a different mood each day; that doesn't mean they change genders. It just means they feel more carefree one day and are conflating that with ""feeling female."" I've spoken to a few ""genderqueer"" people, and in the end it just seems to come down to dislike with *societal* gender roles - girls who want to look and dress boyish, for example, but still do ""feminine things."" It seems to me that instead of trying to show society that a girl needn't be feminine, they're just making up yet another label, and I don't think those are valid. CMV."	"The word ""gender"" actually does mean social identity rather than biological. However, even in biology it can get confusing such as with Kleinfelter's syndrome (having 'XXY' or 'XYY' chromosomes), or Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (genetically male, phenotypically sterile female--some AIS patients become supermodels because their insensitivity to testosterone makes them ""super-feminine""). At worst, ""genderqueer"" or ""agender"" is harmless, at best it may be better than an even worse acquired personality disorder brought on by stress.

cb65bm4	A very religious friend of mine constantly posts overly religious and sometimes bigoted views against homosexuality and abortion, among other issues. They were recently accepted into medical school. I do not have faith in his ability to be a fair, unbiased medical doctor that is more concerned with the best way to treat his patient, rather than furthering a personal agenda. In addition, I think understanding evolution and biological concepts in contrast to their beliefs is a major issue that prevents their understanding of the human body. I understand that religious beliefs and pressing your views onto others are not mutually inclusive; however, I believe if a person fundamentally believes in their religion, they would be morally repulsed by the act of abortion or homosexuality and would not provide the best treatment possible. What's your take?	Well, more importantly, what kindof doctor is he planning to be? Is he planning on being an orthopedic surgeon like my dad? If so, his view on abortion/evolution/homosexuality has absolutely no bearing on the quality of his work. A broken bone doesn't take into account the doctor's beliefs to decide how fast it will heal. If he's repulsed by abortion, then I'm assuming he won't become a doctor at an abortion clinic. I don't really see how this affects anything. And unless his disapproval of homosexuals is so great that he actually refuses to operate/practice on one then I can't really see how any of this affects anything. Can people who hold those beliefs also not become firefighters? Or policemen? Or meteorologists?

EDIT - or if I'm missing some argument you make, which is important because my problem with this argument is that the premises don't imply the conclusion. * Premise 1: Men are forced to pursue women in order to have sex. * Premise 2: Women therefore have more opportunities to have sex, particularly if they are attractive. * Conclusion: The culture looks down on women who accept more of these opportunities. Even if you agree with the premises, I really don't see how you get from the premises to the conclusion.	I would say: Premise 1: Both men and women desire sex. Premise 2: Most men have to pursue a woman in order to have sex, whereas most women do not have to pursue men in order to have sex; i.e., they are pursued. Premise 3: An attractive man may pursue five women and receive five rejections, whereas an attractive woman may receive five appeals and simply has to choose one. Premise 4: Women are not objects and deserve to express their sexual desires. Conclusion: An attractive woman who wants to have sex can express her sexual desires and have sex without having to pursue anyone; i.e., without really working for it at all; i.e. by abusing the system. Again, I don't support these views, I'm just trying to tease out the logic. Is that a little bit clearer?

cjz3cqy	This is a double standard I've never understood. When a European individual or political party wishes to limit the number of immigrants it takes in, or wants a more homogeneous society, they are instantly and viciously pounced on and attacked by the left. They will be accused of all manner of horrible things for expressing such an opinion. However, these same leftists never criticize Japan, despite being a first-world nation that pretty much doesn't allow immigration at all and has an almost entirely homogeneous society. This seems like a pretty indefensible double standard to me. Either anti-immigration Europeans and anti-immigration Japanese are both horrible racist Hitler Nazis, or neither are. _____ 	"I wouldn't really call the left ""pro immigration"" in that they don't want to just open the boarders and let anyone in who wants to immigrate. Their solutions to illegal immigration are more top down than bottom up. The conservative solution tends to be: find the illegal immigrants and deport them. The market will respond to the decrease in the size of the labor force and raise wages. The liberal solution tends to be: go after the employers that exploit illegal immigrant labor to remove the incentive to immigrate illegally while giving a path to citizenship to the ones that already built lives here. As for Japan, the reason nobody really cares about their racism, is that there isn't anyone there for them to oppress. It isn't hurting anyone. If Japan had an illegal immigration problem, and they were treating those people poorly, then it would be an issue, but there aren't any immigrants. I do think Japanese culture should be more accepting, and it's going to have to be in the next few decades to keep their economy going, but since they're not really harming anyone, that cultural nitpick is pretty low priority."	0.9462651872218008	0.0	0.6182450298282404	0.5273179854716311	0.9910760598382222	negative	0.0007245343294925	GPT	0.5988247394561768	0.0184941403567791	70.25520496224381	14.592448759439051	4.388349514563107	1.3398058252427185	0.5970873786407767	0.17567567567567569	0.12612612612612611

It seems to me that most Gypsies now are travelling thieves. They move around the country, stealing things if they want them and never suffering consequences. They will squat illegally on local land and can move on before they can be sentenced. Land has been given to them to live on and it turns into a mess because of their ""I'm leaving, why do I care about it?"" attitude. They don't pay taxes, but will happily take advantage of the medical system if they need it and give nothing back unlike people who live in houses."	Gypsies is a racial, and generally racist term. Saying that Gypsies are asking for special treatment in the UK is like an American saying that niggers are asking for special treatment. I agree that traveling groups of thieves and homeless should not be given special treatment regardless of their heritage.

I'd walk away not because of any score, but because it's obvious that nobody is interested in any *actual* discussion, so they resort to downvotes. Downvotes also lower the chances of other people seeing posts, which means even fewer replies and less discussion. This all depends on the discussion, of course.

cftr0xk	Let me be as clear as possible: I’m talking only about the Army, the main branch of the United States Armed Forces, responsible for land-based military operations. I think that U.S. should keep other military branches (Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard) as they are. The equipment (tanks, guns…) and the personnel of the current Army should be allocated to U.S. states, so that they can incorporate them into state National Guards. That way the ability to defend the country in case of a foreign invasion would not be diminished, but it would reduce the ability of the federal government to wage imperialistic wars around the world. As we know, “power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely”. That’s why we have separation of political powers (into legislature, executive, and judiciary) and a balance of power between U.S. state governments and the federal government. I think military power should have separation as well. (I gave an example of U.S. Army, but similar argument could be made for other countries with strong militaries, too).	I kinda like this idea. We really don't have proper militias anymore.

cdky6vv	Your first point is wrong, Lincoln had plenty of chances to fuck up during his two terms, but he kicked ass instead. Lincoln defeated better known and more experienced candidates to become president, pretty much raised an army from scratch (because there were a lot of rebels, and spies, in the current army), produced the Emancipation Proclamation to a North weary of war and VERY worried about blacks taking northern jobs, deftly kept European powers (many of whom were highly dependent on cotton) from entering into the fray, extended the Civil War when the South and MANY northerners wanted to have peace so that he could ensure that the 13th amendment could be passed, and oh yeah, kept the country together and won a Civil War which the South pretty much only had to not lose in order to win (the north had to overwhelm while the South could have dragged it out). The majority of scholars consider him to be the best president http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States Who are these scholars you allude to? 	Oh he was a great man no doubt, the point was just that he might have been seen in a different light if he was president during ordinary peace time and not a war leader. The nationalism of the time and the fact he was on the victorious side gives some bias to his image. And the North did have the upper hand in the war. The South had some advantage from fighting a defensive war, but it's not terribly surprising the North won (though hindsight bias is probably responsible for that.)	0.9462651872218008	0.482159360969681	0.809656833416415	0.6230238872657183	0.9182958340544896	neutral	3.2693253160687163e-05	GPT	0.1596710085868835	0.3299173712730407	81.35237903225809	14.031182795698925	4.139784946236559	1.2043010752688172	0.6989247311827957	0.12871287128712872	0.10891089108910891

choztm2	Even so, you won't be as sick as if you smoke a pack of cigarettes every day.	"Well, doing mushrooms like that is a very heavy mental load. Some people can't reconcile that kind of experience mentally, and they have difficulty distinguishing a normal state from an altered state. It's a bit of crapshoot between being KOed from normal life for a while and having that ""hangover"" for weeks/months, or maybe longer if you are very very unlucky, or generally being a smelly shitball. This is all a hypothetical. I doubt most drug users would use mushrooms everyday. I have faith in the intelligence of humanity."	0.7139509316223277	0.8783471047618534	0.9462651872218008	0.4248308683213957	0.9910760598382222	negative	0.0177785828709602	expert	0.7801896333694458	0.0199265144765377	68.29604838709679	11.791397849462365	4.580645161290323	1.4516129032258065	0.7634408602150538	0.17142857142857143	0.12380952380952381
cq41u1y	"This is in regards to John Oliver's interview with Edward Snowden. Oliver used the analogy of ""dick pics"" to demonstrate how information can be obtained by the government even if the data is sent on domestic soil. I am a law abiding citizen who has never sent out dick pics or have done anything illegal. I am your average Joe Shmoe. I think that people are being paranoid and self centered when they think that the government is out to get them. I have nothing to hide and therefore believe that there is no danger in the government monitoring me. _____ "	Firstly, there's plenty of legal stuff people would rather keep to themselves. The government might not care, but if the information is collected, it can be used by a many actors, not all of which are indifferent. Secondly, the fact you have nothing to hide now doesn't mean you'll never have something to hide. Laws change and, sometimes, not for the best. At any rate, it sounds safer to not let such precedent happen. 	0.7548533836336261	0.482159360969681	0.6182450298282404	0.7139509316223277	0.9182958340544896	neutral	3.274276969023049e-05	negative	0.4242278635501861	0.0290860664099454	81.45484615384616	10.342564102564104	4.243589743589744	1.294871794871795	0.8333333333333334	0.12222222222222222	0.08888888888888889
cl2qexg	I am not sure I agree that the show is meant to help the restaurant succeed. Their primary goal is entertainment, they often berate people and do pretty static re-designs of their restaurants. The restaurants they visited had no higher chance of being pulled out of failure than restaurants they didn't visit, according to one article. It's very possible that the reason he felt so bad about it was because his failure was suddenly much more public and the blame had been pinned on him by the TV show. At least if your restaurant fails without that you can always blame other factors, the economy, the location, unexpected cultural shifts. But when someone comes up to you and says it's your fault if the restaurant sinks to the bottom of the Hudson, then when it fails you jump into said Hudson (a statistically unlikely way to commit suicide) I think it's tough to just brush off the show as having had no impact.	But the show really does help many restaurants. His criticisms help them address shortcomings, and the name Ramsay alone helps them relaunch. I've visited one whilst on holiday without realising it, simply because it's a unique feature to have his name attached to a restaurant in a given area, so if you've no idea where to eat you simply opt in favour of that one, assuming it looks half decent. Tough love is what you sign up for with Ramsay, everyone knows that. 	0.7909769782074465	0.579380164285695	0.6826061944859853	0.5273179854716311	0.9182958340544896	positive	3.2012536394177005e-05	GPT	0.0262354686856269	0.7979496121406555	67.9497093023256	13.716279069767445	4.325581395348837	1.3837209302325582	0.7906976744186046	0.15789473684210525	0.11578947368421053
cb8qmny	I'm not sure having access to porn for non-straight children so that they can figure out their sexuality is a necessity though, and I'm not convinced that it does outweigh the harm that pornography can do, especially to children. Non-straight children would still have access to erotic literature and websites discussing sexuality, which I feel would be a lot more helpful to them than porn. I may be biased though, because I really dislike most porn in general and feel that it does more harm than good.	I agree with everything you say. I guess I've never watched gay porn, so I couldn't say for sure whether its likely to be as damaging as straight porn but I've read *about* gay porn in academic literature and it certainly doesn't seem like a panacea for a young individual confused about their sexuality. I think the conclusion you have to reach is that 'fundamentalists shaming children for their sexuality' is wrong rather than 'porn for gay people is right'	0.9690222556651344	0.3429509801981278	0.9283832117695864	0.2341004634882825	1.0	neutral	0.6473855376243591	GPT	0.2423451393842697	0.0981736704707145	65.59414728682174	17.048062015503877	4.27906976744186	1.3255813953488371	0.6976744186046512	0.1827956989247312	0.12903225806451613
cd5pn21	A core principle of western liberal egalitarian societies is that all citizens should be treated equally before the law. Why should such oaths only be required of citizens who want to acquire their citizenship via naturalisation, but not of citizens who acquired their citizenship status upon birth?	This, if only I had more upvotes to give. edit: The two paradigms the original poster proposes describe a very dangerous kind of double-think. He wants respect for freedom, liberty and democracy, but he doesn't want to uphold those values in demanding them. There are two possible reasons why he might want this rule. Either a) He wants to use it to filter through applicants, only get the people who are willing to make such an oath, the others should stay home or b) he hopes to force people to change their minds with the promise of a better life in exchange. In both cases, it's ridiculous to assume that nobody would lie, and it's preposterous to think it could be enforceable without a huge, almost arbitrary system of thought police. It would turn immigrants into a kind of secondary citizen, always subject to accusations that they aren't 'western enough'. If we respect freedom, we also respect it for the people who we happen to disagree with.	0.9823887817956214	0.579380164285695	0.9101415926479804	0.6182450298282404	0.7642045065086203	negative	0.000825521769002	GPT	0.5296302437782288	0.0487779788672924	74.41166666666669	12.33103448275862	4.362068965517241	1.3333333333333333	0.6954022988505747	0.17346938775510204	0.10204081632653061
