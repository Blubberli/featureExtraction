The word "gender" actually does mean social identity rather than biological. However, even in biology it can get confusing such as with Kleinfelter's syndrome (having 'XXY' or 'XYY' chromosomes), or Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (genetically male, phenotypically sterile female--some AIS patients become supermodels because their insensitivity to testosterone makes them "super-feminine"). At worst, "genderqueer" or "agender" is harmless, at best it may be better than an even worse acquired personality disorder brought on by stress. If I were to Change Your View, I'd say maybe consider these alternative identities to be harmless social release valves.
