Naturally smart people make average intelligence people stupid by comparison. Someone being smart does not make someone else dumber. Intelligence is not a zero sum game. Genetic modification is equally not a zero sum game. This is simply entitled whining. To address your 'concern': all technologies invented can only be afforded by the rich... for a small amount of time. "If we invent DVD players only the rich will be able to afford it."
