The Bosting Bombing was not a threat to the US. In no way was there any chance at any point that this attack could've disabled parts of the US government, infrastructure, economy or any other vital part of the US as a country -- as an actual war would. Terrorist attacks are horrible, outragous, despicable acts of violence. But the only way they can actually harm a whole country is by inducing fear into the population, which then results in pointless, populist legislature that costs money and personal freedom.
