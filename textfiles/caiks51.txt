Canada (maybe just Quebec?) does this for people over 80. I think it's every 2 years. It should probably be implemented closer to 65 or 70 and maybe every 3-5 years at first. But taking someone's license away is considered serious business and usually requires a doctor to actively pursue it or a failed test.
