&>>I believe that the phone that is most beneficial to own is the one that most other people own. CMV This seems like an obvious statement. Of course people want things that are good and beneficial, so they obviously buy them. I don't think that I understand what your trying to say. &>>Essentially, I think it's always the most socially beneficial to own the most popular product, and this can even be applied to other products, not just phones. Personally I buy things because they are useful, functional, aesthetically pleasing, not because other people have this product. I try not to be affected by social pressure when buying stuff, but I definitely agree that the Apple hive mindset definitely affects consumers. However this is hardly the greatest reason that iphones or other popular phones are popular: I would think that it is because of their pleasant operating system and visually appealing exterior.
