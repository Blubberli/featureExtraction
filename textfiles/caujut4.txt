The thing is different people are willing to spend different amounts on the same service/good. The amount of price people are willing to pay forms a bell curve. Once you set a price you are serving all people on one side of the line and are totally denying service to everyone on the other side of the line. The people who are paying are happy since they are paying a price they are comfortable with or even cheaper. Those people who are unwilling to pay your cost and are not served at all and are unhappy. Price discrimination allows you to address the needs of those people. You offer them a slightly inconvenient coupon that is only good on Wednesday and now the price is lowered for them so that they are willing to pay. They're happy, everyone paying the normal price is happy, and you're happy. It's win/win/win. If you disallow price discrimination you would never serve the needs of these people. If you lowered the price for everyone then you end up losing money from all those people who are perfectly happy with the normal price.
