IPOs are cash grabs. They are good for generating huge amounts of capital needed for investment from *people who can actually afford it*. Sure, bill gates and warren buffet may some day use kick starter, but the shear amounts needed by industry are orders of magnitude greater than kickstarters turnover. So unless kick starter develops a method to encourage serious investment on the scale of billions instead of, what was the largest one again? 10 million? Industry sneezes at ten million. Stocks are a guaranteed portion of that companies future profits in return for a sum of capital upfront used for investment. Kickstarter is a sum of capital up front for whatever the dev deems appropriate, an album, a game, etc. Stocks can be retraded for a loss or gain when the investor feels it is right.
