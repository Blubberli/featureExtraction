Well, more importantly, what kindof doctor is he planning to be? Is he planning on being an orthopedic surgeon like my dad? If so, his view on abortion/evolution/homosexuality has absolutely no bearing on the quality of his work. A broken bone doesn't take into account the doctor's beliefs to decide how fast it will heal. If he's repulsed by abortion, then I'm assuming he won't become a doctor at an abortion clinic. I don't really see how this affects anything. And unless his disapproval of homosexuals is so great that he actually refuses to operate/practice on one then I can't really see how any of this affects anything. Can people who hold those beliefs also not become firefighters? Or policemen? Or meteorologists? What is so special about the medical field that you have to be accepting of homosexuality and abortion that doesn't exist in any other profession
