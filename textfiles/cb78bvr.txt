Keeping offensive words helps us to know exactly who harbors discriminatory feelings towards certain groups. The clearer the offensive meaning is, the less likely they will be able to use a words' ambiguity as an excuse when they are being called out on their bigotry. "Taking back" words will only cause bigots to choose new words. [Possibilities are endless](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:male_homosexual), and I don't see how we would manage to take back *all* pejorative terms. And even if we did manage to, bigots would just use more generic expressions to express the same bigotry, e.g. "gays are sick" etc.
