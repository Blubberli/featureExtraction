I agree with everything you say. I guess I've never watched gay porn, so I couldn't say for sure whether its likely to be as damaging as straight porn but I've read *about* gay porn in academic literature and it certainly doesn't seem like a panacea for a young individual confused about their sexuality. I think the conclusion you have to reach is that 'fundamentalists shaming children for their sexuality' is wrong rather than 'porn for gay people is right'
