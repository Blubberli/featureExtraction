How are you going to enjoy your cars, houses, and life if you're stuck spending 80 hours a week doing something that makes you miserable? I've also heard that a lot of people that go into finance to become bankers for money, burn out btw. If your interests are in entertainment type stuff, you should get skills in those fields and try to land a job in music industry for example. You don't have to become a musician, but you can probably land a pretty good job with a decent salary, and most importantly, love what you do. Imagine waking up one day when you're 60 and realizing you've wasted your life doing something you hate.
