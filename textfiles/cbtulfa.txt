Alright, I will one up you then. Anybody involved with a corporation or industry receiving subsidies, bailouts, or corporate welfare is explicitly forbidden from voting AND donating any money to any political cause what so ever. The people on food stamps are hardly worth worrying about if you look at the amount of corporate welfare going on. Why cry about a paper cut when your arm was freshly dismembered?
