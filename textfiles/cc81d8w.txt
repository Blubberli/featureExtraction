I would say: Premise 1: Both men and women desire sex. Premise 2: Most men have to pursue a woman in order to have sex, whereas most women do not have to pursue men in order to have sex; i.e., they are pursued. Premise 3: An attractive man may pursue five women and receive five rejections, whereas an attractive woman may receive five appeals and simply has to choose one. Premise 4: Women are not objects and deserve to express their sexual desires. Conclusion: An attractive woman who wants to have sex can express her sexual desires and have sex without having to pursue anyone; i.e., without really working for it at all; i.e. by abusing the system. Again, I don't support these views, I'm just trying to tease out the logic. Is that a little bit clearer? Don't hesitate to say that it's not.
