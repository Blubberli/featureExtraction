A Nobel peace prize, not a Nobel prize in science. The peace prize is heavily politicized, as we all know. I was hoping for a more distilled argument than "read the body of work of several authors". I've seen arguments against anthropogenic climate change from several authors, and they all seem to boil down to something like "the models contain inaccuracies" or "it might not be as bad as they're predicting", or sometimes just an argument that's completely off-base in terms of how analyzing data works. I've yet to see something convincing that contradicts the premise that human activity is altering the global climate in some way (for example, a sound refuting of the greenhouse effect). That's not to say it isn't out there, I just haven't seen it yet.
