This, if only I had more upvotes to give. edit: The two paradigms the original poster proposes describe a very dangerous kind of double-think. He wants respect for freedom, liberty and democracy, but he doesn't want to uphold those values in demanding them. There are two possible reasons why he might want this rule. Either a) He wants to use it to filter through applicants, only get the people who are willing to make such an oath, the others should stay home or b) he hopes to force people to change their minds with the promise of a better life in exchange. In both cases, it's ridiculous to assume that nobody would lie, and it's preposterous to think it could be enforceable without a huge, almost arbitrary system of thought police. It would turn immigrants into a kind of secondary citizen, always subject to accusations that they aren't 'western enough'. If we respect freedom, we also respect it for the people who we happen to disagree with.
