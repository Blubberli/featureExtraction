While the ACA is written in the way you describe (Obama specifically met with the leadership of many insurance companies in order to ensure they would be on board), it nevertheless poses an existential risk for insurance companies. Right now, our health care system is a kludge of insurance-based, government-provided, and self-pay. The ACA increasingly penalizes the self-pay category, which in the short run drives them towards the insurance-based category. However, there is a strong possibility that eliminating the self-pay category will eliminate many of the remaining market incentives in the system, resulting an increased drive towards single-payer health care. Simultaneously, the government will be able to regulate health insurance plans more and more heavily - it currently imposes extra requirements on "bare bones" insurance and taxes "Cadillac" insurance - encouraging more and more uniformity until the companies' products look identical to government coverage. This also helps forge a potential path towards single-payer health care. This is how Obama sold the plan to progressives, certainly - and I don't think anyone knows how it will actually play out. So even if the ACA helps insurance companies profit in the short run, it may nevertheless lead eventually to their destruction.
