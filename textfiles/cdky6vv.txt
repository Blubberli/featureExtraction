Oh he was a great man no doubt, the point was just that he might have been seen in a different light if he was president during ordinary peace time and not a war leader. The nationalism of the time and the fact he was on the victorious side gives some bias to his image. And the North did have the upper hand in the war. The South had some advantage from fighting a defensive war, but it's not terribly surprising the North won (though hindsight bias is probably responsible for that.)
