What happens when we fully automate factories, and lose those jobs to automation and technology? Not long ago, you might need 5 Linux sysadmins to manage 1000 servers. Now with tools like puppet or cfengine you need 2. The basic point is that technology and automation will remove available jobs, and they will not be replaced by other 'more skilled' jobs. We will get to a point where more than 50% of the population simply cannot be employed.
