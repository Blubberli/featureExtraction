Why is 'mom-said' a better argument? I would imagine it is subjective, rather than absolute. My original post to the OP used an example regarding an early theory of gravity, in relation to it only applying to objects with mass. Despite this being scientifically valid at the time, it turned out to be incorrect, as it was later found to affect non-masses. Is the fact that it was wrong make the original theory a lie, and those that spread it liars? If it was not a lie, why not?
