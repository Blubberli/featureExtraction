Bitcoins and litecoins both follow the same deflationary pattern. They are stores of wealth, which can be used as a currency, but it's not ideal as everyone knows there is a limited amount, leading to a tendency to hoard and speculate. They won't actually crash until something that actually is a viable currency both shows up and establishes a presence, however.
