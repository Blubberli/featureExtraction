So you think individualism is a hoax. We all deserve to be treated according to the group we belong to. Men are bad, women are good. OK, let's roll with that. Organ-donors are good. Drug-peddlers are bad. What about male organ donors? Female drug-peddlers? Good or bad? I find it hard to believe that anyone can honestly defend the position that individuals should be treated according to some group they belong to. I have to assume you are a troll.
