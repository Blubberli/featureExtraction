Well it definitely depends on the kind of rape, I'll give you that. I'm certain a percentage of date rapes are for the sex. But rape via strangers or acquaintances/borderline-strangers is almost always about the power dynamic. I can go look for interviews from rapists and the victims about this, if you're interested. For the record, I personally believe acted upon pedophilia is also split between sexual desire and the power dynamic.
