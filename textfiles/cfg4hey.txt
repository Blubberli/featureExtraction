She didn't ask him because she wanted him to ask her. If any she wants to ask any him, that's fine. I know multiple couples where she asked him. Too anecdotal? The entire premise of this CMV is anecdotal. Some chump up there wrote that "happiness is limited by societal expectations all the time." Is that our goal? To make everyone happy with societal expectations? Or to get rid of societal expectations? Here's the thing: if a woman proposes and it freaks him out, then that (presumable) feminist is with the wrong guy. Case closed, get on with your life. Societal expectations are always evolving, and complaining that guys are more likely to propose than girls is trivial. [Here are the numbers](http://www.livescience.com/25198-who-should-propose-marriage.html), if you're letting YOUR happiness get hung up on something like this, if you want to be so incredibly insistent that the rest of the world is wrong, then I think we have an extreme case of narcissism.
