&>>We're reaching the same conclusions Likely but the problem is that OP is categorically saying that a parent shouldn't be controlling their children's sexuality and that just doesn't make any sense. It's precisely a parent's job to stop dangerous behaviors. Is it possible to control a child's sexuality in a negative way? ABSOLUTELY. But saying that a parent doing their job is *inherently* controlling, possessive and a result of ''patriarchy'' is utter nonsense. &>>2) there's a difference between teaching a child good decision making skills, and preventing them from making healthy, learning mistakes. Yes but you have to accept that it's the parent's job to define what is a healthy, learning mistake not what YOU think is healthy.
