Up until people started using it as an insult it was a medical term. If people started using 'Autistic' as an insult (which I've seen happen) and people start to take offense will we have to make Autistic a taboo term and find a replacement word? I say we do the same thing that the gay community did with the words 'queer' and 'gay' and embrace them so that bigots have less ammunition
