Gypsies is a racial, and generally racist term. Saying that Gypsies are asking for special treatment in the UK is like an American saying that niggers are asking for special treatment. I agree that traveling groups of thieves and homeless should not be given special treatment regardless of their heritage. But saying Gypsies is incredibly racist.
