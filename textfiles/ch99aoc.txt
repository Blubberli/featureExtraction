I'd walk away not because of any score, but because it's obvious that nobody is interested in any *actual* discussion, so they resort to downvotes. Downvotes also lower the chances of other people seeing posts, which means even fewer replies and less discussion. This all depends on the discussion, of course. Most of the time it's just a few drive-by assholes with a few others actually interested in discussion. But as I mentioned, downvotes lower visibility, which is very important in getting a good discussion going.
