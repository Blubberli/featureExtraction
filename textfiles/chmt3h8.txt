I agree that there is no inherent meaning to live. The key world there is inherent. Since you are alive, why not do something meaningful with it. Instead of taking your realization as a negative (there is no greater meaning to life so I don't care), go the positive route and get the most out of it. Think it out, try to do the bare minimum of things you think are stupid expectations and spend your time doing things that bring you happiness. Just because you have no inherent purpose doesn't mean you can't create one.
