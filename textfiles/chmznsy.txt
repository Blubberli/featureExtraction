Calc 1 teaches a defined sets of concepts: Limits, derivatives, single variable Integrals. It is perfectly possible for the vast majority of students to objectively MASTER these concepts. Are you saying that if the professor determines that 84% of the class has mastered the concepts taught during the class, she should arbitrarily increase the difficulty of the questions above and beyond the concepts that were studied during the class?
