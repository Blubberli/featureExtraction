Well, doing mushrooms like that is a very heavy mental load. Some people can't reconcile that kind of experience mentally, and they have difficulty distinguishing a normal state from an altered state. It's a bit of crapshoot between being KOed from normal life for a while and having that "hangover" for weeks/months, or maybe longer if you are very very unlucky, or generally being a smelly shitball. This is all a hypothetical. I doubt most drug users would use mushrooms everyday. I have faith in the intelligence of humanity.
