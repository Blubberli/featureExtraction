So are you suggesting a system where anyone who's identified as a target through other means, should start to have their online communications collected and monitored? (As opposed to the current system, where everyone's communications are collected). I guess that isn't as bad on moral grounds (if it's coming from a warrant with reasonable suspicion), and as you say could be a lot cheaper. That's basically what subpoenas are for.
