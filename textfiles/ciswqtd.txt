&>> Do you think it's unreasonable for a native English speaker who is learning a foreign language - in this case, Latin - to also try to learn the pronunciation of that language, instead of applying English pronunciation to Latin spelling? Everyone tries, and everyone fails. Accents are very hard to overcome. I'd be very interested to hear a recording of your voice, so I can judge you by your accent. America's dirty little secret: Your accent when speaking our language is *just as bad as ours when speaking yours!* We're just not rude enough to make an issue of it.
