I want to second the horribleness that is the last 2min of any Basketball game. I used to play, I like the game, my dad watches it pretty religiously but I hate the last 2min that consists of nothing but intentional fouls and shots from the line then the other team going for a quick 3 pointer with that 2min stretching almost 20min each bloody time.
