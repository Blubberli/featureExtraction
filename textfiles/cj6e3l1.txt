It depends. The higher paying job could be much harder and carry greater responsibility that I don't want. People choose lower paying jobs all the time. But you are comparing two jobs where I have to show up. The real choice provided by OPs scheme is between a salary that I get for doing nothing versus a perhaps higher salary that I have to devote 40+ hours a week for the majority of my lifetime for doing things that I have no real interest in. Almost everybody will prefer the first, including me and you. We'd feel like suckers going to work while others are partying all day on their UBI. Because that's what we would be.
