I wouldn't really call the left "pro immigration" in that they don't want to just open the boarders and let anyone in who wants to immigrate. Their solutions to illegal immigration are more top down than bottom up. The conservative solution tends to be: find the illegal immigrants and deport them. The market will respond to the decrease in the size of the labor force and raise wages. The liberal solution tends to be: go after the employers that exploit illegal immigrant labor to remove the incentive to immigrate illegally while giving a path to citizenship to the ones that already built lives here. As for Japan, the reason nobody really cares about their racism, is that there isn't anyone there for them to oppress. It isn't hurting anyone. If Japan had an illegal immigration problem, and they were treating those people poorly, then it would be an issue, but there aren't any immigrants. I do think Japanese culture should be more accepting, and it's going to have to be in the next few decades to keep their economy going, but since they're not really harming anyone, that cultural nitpick is pretty low priority.
