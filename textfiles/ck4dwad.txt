Goodness, yes, of course there are "legitimate" arguments on both sides. There are legitimate arguments for and against marriage equality. There are legitimate arguments against marriage itself. It depends on how low you set the bar for legitimate. I'm not aware of any specific abuses in early 20th century gay culture either. I'm saying that pushing a group underground leaves that group ripe to abuse and be abused. Partners today are already slow to report abuse, I'd wager it'd be slower if the victim also faced arrest. (when you bring the child sex argument into the equation, please remember that the same types of arguments were used by awful bigots against same-gender marriage. You should be mindful to tread lightly.) Furries can take off their ourfits. It's really hard to hide your husband (gay or straight), or your husbands (gay or straight, plural). If we normalize plural relationships we can help victims. If normalized I'd wager they'd have similar rates of abuse to other households.
