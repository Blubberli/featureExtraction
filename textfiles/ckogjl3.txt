So? That doesn't show that PC needs consoles, just that PC games improve at generally the same rate - which, by the way, isn't even true. PC games have been at "X-Box One/PS4 era" graphics since the PS3/360 era. Have you seen Skyrim and Bioshock in 4K? You can't even do that on a PS4, and those are last generation games. Also, think back to the 90s. We had games in 1997 (Half-Life) that couldn't be ported to console until 2001 (PS2.) I think in many ways PC has been always one generation ahead.
