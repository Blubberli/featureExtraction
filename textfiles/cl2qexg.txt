But the show really does help many restaurants. His criticisms help them address shortcomings, and the name Ramsay alone helps them relaunch. I've visited one whilst on holiday without realising it, simply because it's a unique feature to have his name attached to a restaurant in a given area, so if you've no idea where to eat you simply opt in favour of that one, assuming it looks half decent. Tough love is what you sign up for with Ramsay, everyone knows that.
