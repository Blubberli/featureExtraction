The thing is that, the bad stuff you are hearing are the loud weirdos. It's like going to tumblr in action and then complaining that tumblr is a shithole and that the internet is horrible and we are all gona die in a feminazi hell. Well, that's what I get for going to those places! The world is not like that, not even the internet is like that. Also, as I've said before, tumblr is for porn. If you actually go there, you'll get amazing drawings "borrowed" from deviantart, impossibly beautiful houses, and porn.
