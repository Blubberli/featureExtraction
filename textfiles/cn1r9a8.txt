I understand your concern that this trend eventually will lead to the concept of a job becoming obsolete. But I don't agree that we're losing jobs at even nearly that rate. Do you have any data to support that available jobs are disappearing at 50%? Considering there's only been a slight upward trend in unemployment in the US over the past 50 years, I really doubt this is the case. I also think you should consider that the creation of a new industry does not necessarily wipe out the old one. For example, cloud computing is a relatively new industry that's risen quickly in the past 5 years but it hasn't replaced the software industry. Instead, cloud computing delivers applications in a way that traditional software can't, but still serves the same purpose. This is what I'm talking about - needing intelligent, competent people moving in to fill those little crevices and create growing industries that provide jobs.
