I don't know if I'd call it "forcing" them to go to church with them. I'm picturing parents with a five year old here. Parents go to church, so does the kid. Parents go to the market, so does the kid. Parents go to the library, kid too. I bet that kid is going to grow up having particular feelings about a certain recipe mom made and with a certain attitude toward reading because of where their parents took them.
