Okay, so install base is just "units sold". Which changes nothing in my question. Which games do you know of where we know how many players are on which platform and know that there were huge differences in sales? Also, do you think every GPU capable of high FPS automatically makes a gamer? And since 2010 about 4 years passed. Which is quite a long time in the industry.
