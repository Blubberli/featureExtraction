I understand your concern about his skeptic attitudes towards climate change but that specific committee deals with issues far beyond climate change in the general areas of science and technology. Just because he has politically motivated beliefs about climate change doesn't mean he is anti-science in any other area of policy (he's not anti-space is he?) If you don't like that argument would you be as concerned about an anti-GMO democrat in that subcommittee? Anti-Nuclear energy?
