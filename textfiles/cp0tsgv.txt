Parks and Rec mocked one feminist organization; it completely disregarded all of men's issues. &>>Men deal with a lot of crap, but how much of it comes from being considered a lesser type of human? Lesser type of human? Would the past treatment of homosexuals still count? Treatment that still exists in many places? How about men who've been abused who can't handle it, and are now lesser men because they're not keeping it together like a 'real man should'? What about homeless men? What about black and other minority men? Have they never been thought of as lesser humans? What about sexually abused men who are expected to have enjoyed what happened to them, due to societal standards regarding men and sex? What about depressed and suicidal men? Your reply only really reinforces what I believe: that feminism isn't the answer for men, and that for the most part, feminists don't care, ridicule, and minimize the issues they face.
