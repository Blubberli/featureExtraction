If lawmakers passed a law that said that gays cannot vote, it would be enforceable until someone challenges that law. Obviously in such an instance, corruption charges would follow and the law would be ruled unconstitutional after going through the courts, but gays would not be able to vote in the time that the election was help. An unlikely example to be sure, but it was also unlikely that the Supreme Court would okay the baseless imprisonment of the Japanese in WWII, or when it upheld the conviction of a man who published pamphlets informing citizens of their right to resist the draft in WWI.
