How old were you when you read Ender's Game? That was a key part of why I enjoyed it so much, I read it when I was 14. Bean, Ender, and Peter are some of my favorite literary characters ever because I saw a piece of myself in each of them. To your other point about boycotting Card, I respect your decision to hold your personal beliefs above your entertainment.
